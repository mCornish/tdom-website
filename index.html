                </header>
                <p>My name is Mike Cornish. I'm a compulsive creator. When I'm not writing stories or blog posts, I design and develop websites, draw and sketche art, and occasionally create music. His main passion is learning, because it allows him to execute bigger, better, more ambitious creations.</p>
                <p>Some of my most notable accompliishments include working on a Best in Show award-winning website, writing two novels, playing a self-written piano piece before an audience of strangers, interviewing a chart-topping musician, and writing hundreds of blog posts over the past six years.</p>
                <p>I am writing <em>The Dawn of Man</em> in order to tell a story about human strength and weakness. Yes, it is a fantasy novel with magic and horror, but it also examines topics like kinship, xenophobia, and mortality. I hope that <em>The Dawn of Man</em> will take you on an adventure through a new world, but that it will also compel you to analyze the world we live in. </p>

				<h1>Frequently Ask Questions</h1>
			</header>
            <h2>What is <em>The Dawn of Man</em>?</h2>
            <p>Four years ago, I started working on my first ever comic book script called <em>The Cleansing</em>. Through many leaps in logic and creativity, that comic book script eventually turned into a novel, <em>The Dawn of Man</em>. It finished writing it about three years ago and am currently in the process of rewriting with a more immersive setting, deeper characters, and an overall more compelling story.</p>

            <h2>How can I help get <em>The Dawn of Man</em> published?</h2>
            <p>I'm currently working to get <em>The Dawn of Man</em> published through <a href="https://www.inkshares.com/books/the-dawn-of-man-409f1f" target="_blank_">Inkshares campaign</a>. In order for that to happen, I need at least 250 people to pre-order the novel by November 23. For $10, you can pre-order a digital copy and for $20 you can pre-order a signed paperback copy. I still have a long way to go, but I have some plans for how to get there, including the website you're viewing right now!</p>

            <h2>Who will enjoy reading <em>The Dawn of Man</em>?</h2>
            <p>I'm a huge geek who loves comic books like <em>The Walking Dead</em>, sci-fi adventures like <em>Ready Player One</em>and <em>Ender's Game</em>, fantasy journies like <em>Assassin's Apprentice</em> and <em>The Hobbit</em>, and horror stories like those written by Stephen King and H.P. Lovecraft. <em>The Dawn of Man</em> is inspired by the type of storytelling and writing in these kinds of stories, but I would narrow the genre down to "fantasy with horror-like inclinations". I'll let you draw your own conclusions from there.</p>
